# COVID-19 SES Data Hub, Hopkins Population Center

## HPC Data Hub Phase 3 Release (11/2/2020)
(COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths are updated weekly.)

The HPC Data Hub is a data service infrastructure of the Hopkins Population Center (HPC). The HPC Data Hub offers U.S. county-level data necessary for population-based social science, epidemiological, medical and public health research on COVID-19 to provide evidence-based, timely policy recommendations for curbing the pandemic. 

Timely and effective data on social, economic and health disparities are needed to respond appropriately to the pandemic as local situations change. Drawing from trusted sources, this data hub curates county-level data on the demographic, social and health factors that influence the spread of COVID-19. The data hub also includes data on the status of COVID-19 related policies being rolled out across the country.
